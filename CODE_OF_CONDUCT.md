### Marcin Mikołajczak’s Code of Conduct, version 1 (last update – 20-06-2019)

Code of Conduct… The best place to talk about religion, human races, sexual preferences, gender identity, disabilities and other stuff that is so closely related to programming…  I’ll better avoid taking about it…

But honestly, do you really need a code of conduct in order to be a decent person or act like you’re one while contributing to this project? If so, please, leave this repo…

I know nobody’s gonna contribute to this project, it’s just a draft of ‘code of conduct’ I’ll be using in my other projects.
